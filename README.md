# Dog-Image-Classification
Image Classification w/ Convolutional Neural Networks

The dataset for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset

This project was a mini-project completed at the conclusion of the NSF Data Science Bootcamp (through CSUN). Working in a group of 4, we were able to test different exisitng CNN architectures to find which models could classify dogs by their breed. My main responsibility was the training and testing of the GoogLeNet CNN model. Training CNN's take a very long time! The results from this project were obtained in 2 days time. 

In the project code you will see:

* Pytorch
* Image transformations
* Learning rate schedulers
* Transfer learning
* Tensorboard visualizations
* Model training
